# Orthography
Krestia can be written using the Timeran script, but it's more commonly written in the Latin alphabet. All the sounds of Krestia described in [[Phonology]] are written directly using their respective IPA letters, in addition to "sh" for /ʃ/ and "aa" for /ɒ/. The letters used by Krestia are as follows:

a, b, d, e, g, h, i, k, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, t, u, v

All built-in words are written in lowercase letters, and punctuation marks are not used, since Krestia's grammar makes using them unnecessary for determining sentence boundaries, but they can still be used as a visual aid. Words that are of a foreign origin must begin with a capital letter, and might not follow the standard orthographic rules, and if they contain spaces, these must be removed or replaced with underscores (e.g. "New York" is written "NewYork" or "New_York"), to indicate that they work as a single morpheme.
