# Phonology
Krestia uses a conservative set of sounds in its phonology. It has six vowels and fifteen consonants.
## Sound inventory
Krestia has the following sounds:
- Consonants: m, p, b, v, n, t, d, s, ʃ (spelled "sh"), l, r, k, g, h
- Vowels: a, e, i, ɒ (spelled "aa"), o, u
## Phonotactics
Krestia does not have phonemes, so the sounds remain the same regardless of where they appear. Thus, an "s" between vowels would still be pronounced as /s/, unlike the "s" in "easy".

The syllable structure for the first syllable in a word is (C)(C)V(C), and for the other syllables, (C)V(C). In addition, the following rules apply:
- The initial consonant cluster of the first syllable, if it exists, must be a plosive followed by /l/ or /r/.
- No two consective consonants may have the same manner of articulation, so "ss", "sv", or "tk" are forbidden. However, they may have the same place of articulation.
- If a syllable ends with a nasal, and the next syllable starts with a plosive, the two consonants must have the place of articulation (e.g. "mb" or "nt" are valid, but "mk", or "np" are not)
- Long vowels are forbidden.
- Vowel clusters longer than two vowels are forbidden.
- /h/ may appear only in the beginning of a word.
