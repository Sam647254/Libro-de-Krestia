In Krestia, verbs may have a valency between zero and three, providing up to three argument slots. In common speech, however, not all of a verb's arguments may be known or important enough to be mentioned. In this case, verbs can be **valency-reduced**, allowing them to accept fewer arguments without introducing incomplete sentences or syntactic ambiguities.

Valency reduction is achieved by simply replacing the verb's final consonant with the one that indicates the desired combination of argument slots. Note, however, that verbs cannot have their valencies *increased*. Thus, 0-verbs will not be affected by valency reduction.

The examples use the {{ word "larep" }}, which is a 1-2-3-verb, and therefore shows all possible ways of valency reduction, and the associated change in meaning.

{{ example "Luri larep Levo kunata" }}
Luri is showing Levo the ocean. (all slots present)

{{ example "Luri laret Levo" }}
Luri is showing Levo (something). (slot 3 omitted)

{{ example "Luri laresh Levo kunata" }}
Luri is showing the ocean (to someone). (slot 2 omitted)

{{ example "larev Levo kunata" }}
Levo is being shown the ocean (by someone). (slot 1 omitted)

{{ example "lareg Levo" }}
Levo is being shown (something by someone). (slots 1, 3 omitted)

{{ example "laren kunata" }}
The ocean is being shown (by someone to someone). (slots 1, 2 omitted)

{{ example "larem" }}
The action of showing (of something to someone) is being done (by someone). (all slots omitted)

Also, inflections that derive verbs (such as [[possession]]) may also undergo valency reduction. The exception is the [[translative]], which cannot have its valency reduced. To omit arguments in this case, reduce the valency of the base verb instead. (e.g. _*betelis_, reduced from _betelit_, is invalid; the correct form is _beselis_)
